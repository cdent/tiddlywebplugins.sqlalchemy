This package provides a store for TiddlyWeb using sqlalchemy.

It has been superceeded by tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy2 which has
a more peformant and robust database schema.

If you intend to use this code with sqlite3, make sure you have the
latest versions of sqlite3, pysqlite and sqlalchemy. This is required to
support transactions and constraints effectively.

Licensed as TiddlyWeb itself.
