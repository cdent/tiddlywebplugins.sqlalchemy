This package provides a store for TiddlyWeb using sqlalchemy.

This is a repackaging of the concepts and concerns of the original
sqlstore, renamed to avoid schema and other conflicts.

In the version jump from 0.3 to 0.5 the schema has changed. If you
have existing stores using 0.3 or prior, you will need to use
tiddlywebplugins.migrate. While you can migrate from sql to sql directly
because of namespace collisions it might be easiest to:

    migrate from old sql to text
    remove the sql database
    install the new sqlalchemy plugin
    migrate from text to sql

If you intend to use this code with sqlite3, make sure you have the
latest versions of sqlite3, pysqlite and sqlalchemy. This is required to
support transactions and constraints effectively.
